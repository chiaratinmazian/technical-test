### Developing

You will fetch Github public repositories using the Github API and display their name in a list.
When the user clicks on a repository, they are redirected through this url: `localhost:3000/owner/repo` to a detailed page of the repository with the following information:

- its name
- the owner name
- the number of stars
- the number of watchers

On this page, when clicking on the repository's name, the user is redirected to its original Github page.
